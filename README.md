## Project Overview
This repository stores **manual test cases** developed from SRS-based testing for two systems:

1. **Healthcare Management Application** — functional test cases across user, patient, doctor, admin, billing, and notification modules.  
2. **Online Payment System** — functional and edge-case test cases around authentication, gateway integrations, transactions, refunds, and history.

Test cases are authored in **Excel** (one sheet per module), include Test Case IDs, preconditions, steps, expected results, and execution status (Pass/Fail/Warning). RTM and summary statistics are also included in the Excel workbooks.
